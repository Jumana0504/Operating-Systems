# Virtual Memory and Memory Management (malloc Implementation)

## Description
This project implements a custom memory allocator that mimics the functionality of `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. It focuses on dynamic memory management and virtual memory concepts.

## Features
- Custom implementations of memory management functions.
- Utilizes sbrk() for heap management.

## Homework Assignment
The implementation is based on Homework Exercise 4 from the Operating Systems course (234123) at Technion. You can find the assignment details in the pdf file provided.

## Files
- `malloc_1.cpp` – Naïve Malloc.
- `malloc_2.cpp` –  Basic Malloc.
- `malloc_3.cpp` – Better Malloc.
